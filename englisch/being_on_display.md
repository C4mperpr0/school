# Is it ok to have cameras in public schools


# Bill Gates' Motivation to put a video camera into every classroom in america

- How do the other countries do it? Do they spy on their students too?
- "It's all for the kids"
- I like the idea of the teachers recording on their own. Does every teacher have the required computer skills?
- does teachers have the time to do that?
