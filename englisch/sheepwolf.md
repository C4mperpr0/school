1. The spying sheep in wolf clothing wanted to publish their news/books afap and faster than the other so that in the end they published that wolfs only party all day according to their few hour long stay in wolfland. All other sheep believed that and stopped preparing for wolf attacks. But the wolfs did only party that day and some days later that slaughtered all sheep.
