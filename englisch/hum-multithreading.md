# Ideas for my speachey speach

- need to be constantly reachable
- scientist say we use only 10% of our brains, I just use the other 90% for nine more tasks at the same time.


## When I ride the tram, looking out of the window, I feel time passing by. I am just waiting to arrive. Ten minutes of waiting. Wasted time I will never get back. So why don't check my mails while I am waiting, so I don't have to do it later. Why don't do an annoying call done while walking and why don't do school homework while the game is loading.
## multitasking, or rather fast switching between multiple tasks is the solution for regaining all the time you felt was wasted before. All these minutes that eventually add up to an amount of time in which you could have done some serious work.
## Waiting or walking or working might often be tasks that don't require your full attention? Then let's use the rest of our brains and start running on one hundred percent effectiveness.
## What? You think it doesn't work? Than tell me, how can you breath and devour and speak and even walk all at the same time without considering you a multitasker? Right, evenbody multitasks already all the time. But since most everydaytasks like driving have not been a part of our lives to be evolutionary implemented in our brains, we can't perform those tasks on the same subconsciousness level as breathing for example. But still we should be able to perform it without thinking about it, just like breathing.
## And to those that still are not on my side: Are your brains really so weak, that you need all of your brain to detect wether an big bright light right in front of you is red or green? I don't think so.
## So go out, stop asking and start multitasking.
