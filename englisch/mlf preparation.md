# To pfilip: Isn't a cartoon supposed to focus on one aspect rather than a whole topic? Sure it is meant to make aware of a bigger problem but it does that by displaying one of the aspects, it is not an information poster, so the maximum of text should be very strict in order to be effective in a short timespan and to approach people passing by and not being an information container you have to stand in front of for an hour in order to get them facts
# to jitka: we have schoollaptops and tablets btw, and they dont use that much energy tbh
# Kinderschredder: Windrad aufm Schulhof, geil alter
