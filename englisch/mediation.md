Dear Toni Rigattoni,
since you are writing an assignment about the change of media consume in society during a crisis and wanted my information for it I'm glad to have found an article that matches your request quite well.
The article is an Interview with Frank Schwab, a media psychologist, on Der Spiegel. Schwab claims that absurd beliefs and fake news unfortunatly are not unusual. He thinks because of stressfull situation like when have right now with the pandamic people are welcoming if they are told that this pandemic is all a big hoax and that everything is gonna be fine. And those people won't check what they read on the internet.
Since the web can be so overwhelmingly filled with information so that it is hard to back-check everything, Schwab promotes the idea of communicative hygiene, meaning that one should at least not repost and share information hat without researching its source and correctness.

I hope this information will be helpfull for your assignment,
best wishes,
Carl
